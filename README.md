# Mininet Ryu Tutorial

Proposal - A Mininet and Ryu tutorial in Fabric

This repository builds a topology in Fabric using 2 VMs connected by LAN. One VM acts as our controller, and the other holds our network. Mininet allows us to build a quick and light network in seconds. It has a CLI that can build a network, which the controller can then manage.

In this project
Set up files for Fabric
Mininet topology examples and commands
Ryu controller examples and commands

This repo is for our network project
