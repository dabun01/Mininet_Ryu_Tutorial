    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The data plane consists of all the activity sent by the end user and includes forwarding packets, segmentation and reassembly of data. The control plane is all the activities that do not involve the end user. The control plane is responsible for creating routing tables and setting packet handling policies. Think of this as the brain of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "In SDNs the software that controls the network is separated from the hardware. The control plane is now managed by a centralized controller while the data plane stays in the hardware. This configuration allows us to control and manage the network without having to configure each individual device instead we can adjust the network from one central place. "

    "### 2.2 Intro into Mininet\n",
    "\n",
    "Mininet is a lightweight network emulator that creates a virtual network on a single computer. It is commonly used in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) research, development, and education. Mininet enables users to emulate networks with multiple hosts, switches, and links, allowing them to test and prototype network topologies, applications, and protocols without requiring physical hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to start Mininet\n",
    "1. Go to the host node as it has Mininet preinstalled\n",
    "2. Types ` sudo mn` into the command line this will start the default topology \n",
    "3. Done you have started Mininet and are now in the Mininet Command Line Interface(CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interact with Host and Switches\n",
    "Try the command `pingall` to see if the network is functional \n",
    "\n",
    "The host should ping each other and you can see that in the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a multitude of commands to interact with the environment. Type `help` to see them all \n",
    "`nodes`, `net`, and `dump` are a few commands type each to see what they do.\n",
    " \n",
    "We can also interact with each node and switch individually. If you start your command with the host or the switch name it will be like you are typing into the terminal of each\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this command `h1 ifconfig -a` \n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to see host `h1-eth0` and the loopback\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `exit` into the CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "Now type `sudo mn -c` It is good practice to type this after you are done using Mininet as this will clean up the environment \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use commands to change the topology. Let me show you a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type this command into the terminal of the host node. We can use the topo command to change the topology.\n",

    "2. Start your Ryu controller with the following command :\n",
    "\n",
    "``ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch``\n",

    "`sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.0.0.2,port=6633 --topo single,2 --mac`\n",

    "\n",
    "Type `h1 ping h2 -c 6` and take a note of time of the first packet compared to the rest\n",
    "\n",
    "The first packet takes longer to send because it has to go to the controller first then to its final destination \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.1 standalone vs secure mode\n",
    "The OpenFlow controller manages all flow setups on the switch, meaning that when the controller is not running, no packet switching should occur. However, depending on your network’s configuration, this behavior might not always be ideal. For some setups, it might be preferable for the switch to default to a learning Layer 2 switch when the controller is unavailable. In other cases, this fallback could be undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open vSwitch (OVS) allows you to adjust this behavior through a tunable parameter called fail-safe-mode, which can be configured as follows:\n",
    "-   **standalone** (default): OVS takes over packet forwarding responsibilities if the controller is unavailable.\n",
    "-   **secure**: The controller is solely responsible for packet forwarding. If the controller is down, all packets are dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fail-safe mode is not explicitly set, OVS defaults to standalone mode. For this tutorial, we will set the fail-safe mode to secure, as we want precise control over packet forwarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command provides flow information for all switches.\n",
    "`dpctl dump-flows`\n",
    "\n",
    "And now you have started the controller and connected it to a simple network topology. In the next section we will introduce how to write your own network topologies using python scripts and how to automatically start your controller and build a topology with just one command\n"

    "Now that we have created a mesh topology we want to run it and see it in action. A benefit of a mesh topology is self healing. If a node switch happens for some reason to fail the traffic can be rerouted and the network is still functional \n",

    "`ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_stp_13`\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using a spanning tree protocol controller. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol designed to prevent loops in a Layer 2 network, such as a mesh network. It works by organizing switches into a loop-free topology while still allowing redundancy for fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to start the topology. (Note you might have to cancel then re-run to get it working)\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo mn --custom mesh.py --topo mytopo --controller=remote,ip=10.0.0.2,port=6633`\n",

    "Now use the `dump` and `net` commands to see the connections\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Designated Port: Ports selected to forward traffic to downstream devices. These ports are in the **FORWARD** state.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Non-Designated Port: Ports that would form loops if they forwarded traffic. These ports are in the **BLOCK** state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait a minute or two for the controller to do it's job then run `pingall`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `iperf` command to test the bandwidth between the 2 hosts\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I had mentioned above we can stop a switch and still be able to ping the hosts. (Note in this mesh topology if s1 and s3 are stopped we can not ping the hosts)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To stop a switch run this command `switch s2 stop` and to start `switch s2 start`\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop switch 2 and see what the controller does to account for this change.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Try stopping different switches and running `pingall` and `iperf`\n",
